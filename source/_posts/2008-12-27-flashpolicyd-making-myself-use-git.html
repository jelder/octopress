<p>People who work with me know I treat version control like a sacrament. "If it's not in Subversion, it never happened." My desktop is a Subversion checkout. It has tags.</p><p>But Subversion, despite having a superior name, is losing favor to <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a>. I really like some of Git's philosophical decisions, so I'm diving in. I have one open source side project these days (<a href="http://jelder.blogspot.com/2008/11/fun-with-flash.html">flashpolicyd</a>) and I have just migrated it to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</p><p><a href="http://github.com/jelder/flashpolicyd/">http://github.com/jelder/flashpolicyd/</a>
