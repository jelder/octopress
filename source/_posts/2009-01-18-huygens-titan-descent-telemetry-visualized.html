The camera was funded by NASA. </blockquote><p>The article doesn't do justice to how much beauty exists in this visualization of data. The brief and glorious life of the Huygens lander, dropped from the Cassini probe into the atmosphere of Titan, is compressed from 4 hours to just a few minutes. A unique chime as if from a child's xylophone accompanies each sensor reading. As Huygens' last meters close, the final intrusion of poetry into science is utterly disarming.</p><p>If anyone can find a higher resolution form of this video it would be greatly appreciated.</p>
