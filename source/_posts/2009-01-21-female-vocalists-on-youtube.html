<p>I've had a post on female vocalists brewing for a while and this isn't it. However, you really should take a listen to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/natalydawn">Nataly Dawn</a>. She has that timeless, ethereal sort of sound which I find mesmerizing, and I won't lie; when she makes eye contact with the camera I fall apart a little.</p>

</p>On a somewhat related note, seeing Barack Obama's <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/presidents/896x504/44bo_header2.jpg">face</a> on the new <a href="http://whitehouse.gov">WhiteHouse.gov</a> is like watching boobs bounce in slow motion.</p>
