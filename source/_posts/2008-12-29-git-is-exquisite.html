<p>Possibly the best thing about git is that you can <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-init.html">start from an existing directory</a>. This makes it amazing for tracking configuration files.</p><p><span style="font-family:courier new;">cd /etc/ldap ; git init ; git add . ; git commit -m "got some config religion"</span></p><p>Too bad one can't use <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> for this, but remote backups and batch config changes get really elegant with kind of setup.
