<p>It's practically 2009 and too many of us still use a jumble of letters and numbers as passwords. A New Year's resolution to keep: here's an ultra-short tutorial on never typing your password into a remote host again. First, the MacOS client version.</p><ol><li>Create a key and encrypt the private side with a strong passphrase: <tt>ssh-keygen -t dsa</tt></li><li>Add it to your Keychain: <tt>ssh-add -K .ssh/id_dsa
</tt></li><li>Establish trust: <tt>cat .ssh/id_dsa.pub | ssh some.remote.net tee -a .ssh/authorized_keys</tt> (or email that file to someone who can do this for you)</li><li>Now go disable passwords for SSH on that remote server by adding <tt>PasswordAuthentication no</tt> to <tt>/etc/sshd_config</tt> and restarting the SSH server. You are now immune to SSH brute force attacks.</li></ol><p>Repeat steps 3 and 4 for every remote machine you use, but make sure you have a secure backup of that private key!</p><p>I practically never use Linux from the console any more, so I won't contribute a tutorial for that today. PuTTY and Pagent make this <a href="http://the.earth.li/%7Esgtatham/putty/0.60/htmldoc/Chapter9.html#pageant">pretty damn easy</a> on Windows. No more excuses!</p><p>That solves the shell session password issue. For the rest, the solution isn't so neat and tidy. <span style="font-family:courier new;">sudo apt-get install pwgen</span> to create super strong  (but somewhat memorable) passwords for local accounts and websites. Turn on FileVault or FireFox's master password and <em>let software deal with authentication for you</em>.</p>
