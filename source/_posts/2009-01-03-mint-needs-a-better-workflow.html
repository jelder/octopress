Just posted this to the Mint.com user forums.
<blockquote><p>Most of my Mint's value for us users comes from knowing how our money is getting spent, but one critical part of that use case is missing: a workflow for rapid categorization.</p><p>Mint needs a really slick way to let me sit down once a month and quickly categorize all of my uncatagorized transactions. I should be presented with a queue of transactions from unknown merchants and some method for applying labels, splitting bills, etc. Ideally, I should be able to keep my hands on the keyboard for this, and it should take like 5 minutes a month or less.</p><p>This can be done manually now, of course, but it's far from efficient. The ajax stuff in the transactions tab has improved but it's still too chunky and slow on a modern MacBook Pro and Firefox 3.0. The experience should be less hunt-pick-wait and more next-next-next.</p><p>With more complete vendor preference profiles for each user, Mint should be able to monetize via more focused opportunities. Good luck guys! Mint is great but it's not complete!</blockquote>
