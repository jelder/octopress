<p>I have made available a completely unofficial but functional MacOS Leopard build of git and the excellent <a href="http://wiki.github.com/Caged/gitnub">GitNub</a> viewer. To install, pretend I'm a trustworthy individual and run:</p><p><span style="font-family:courier new;">curl http://jelder.s3.amazonaws.com/git-1.6.1-leopard.tar.gz | sudo tar xvzf - -C /</span></p><p>This will put git in /usr/local/bin/git (with other support files in /usr/local/libexec and /usr/local/share). The nub script in /usr/local/bin/nub will launch GitNub from the current directory.</p>
