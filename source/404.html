Sorry, that page doesn't exist. <span id="guess"/>

<script type="text/javascript">
//<![CDATA[
if (window.location.pathname.indexOf(".html") > 0) {
  suggestion = "The structure of this site changed recently. Could you be looking for <a></a> instead?"
  guess = window.location.pathname.replace(/\.html/,"/")
  console.log("Suggesting " + guess);
  $("#guess").html(suggestion);
  $("#guess a").html(guess);
  $("#guess a").attr("href", guess);
}
